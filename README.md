# Euclidean Algorithm to find inverse of x mod n (with steps!)

Finally, after all these years of having to manually write out all the ridiculously time-consuming steps in the euclidean algorithm, 
you can now rely on this easy to use calculator. All you have to do is boot up your local IDE and run the main function.
This will prompt you with your x and n and solve for the inverse instantly.

under the title "Formula.html"
